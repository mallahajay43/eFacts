            Election Commission
            <hr>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            The <strong>Election Commission of India (ECI)</strong> is an autonomous body under the ownership of
            Ministry of Law and Justice, Government of India. It is established by the Constitution of India directly to
            ensure free and fair elections in the country. Article 324 of the Constitution provides that the power of
            superintendence, direction, and control of elections to parliament, state legislatures, the office of the
            president of India, and the office of vice-president of India shall be vested in the election commission.
            Thus, the Election Commission is an all-India body in the sense that it is common to both the Central
            government and the state governments.
            <br> <br>
            The body administers elections to the Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha, State Legislative Assemblies, State
            Legislative Councils and the offices of the President and Vice President of the country. The Election
            Commission operates under the authority of Constitution per Article 324, and subsequently enacted
            Representation of the People Act. The commission has the powers under the Constitution, to act in an
            appropriate manner when the enacted laws make insufficient provisions to deal with a given situation in the
            conduct of an election.

        <div class="content">
            The commission was established in 1950 and originally only had a Chief Election Commissioner. Two additional
            Commissioners were appointed to the commission for the first time on 16 October 1989 (on the eve of the 1989
            General Election), but they had a very short tenure, ending on 1 January 1990. "The Election Commissioner
            Amendment Act, 1989" was adopted on 1 January 1990 which turned the commission into a multi-member body: a
            3-member Commission has been in operation since then and the decisions by the commission are made by a
            majority vote. The Chief Election Commissioner and the two Election Commissioners who are usually retired
            IAS officers draw salaries and allowances at par with those of the Judges of the Supreme Court of India as
            per the Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners (Conditions of Service) Rules, 1992.
            <br><br>
            The commission is served by its secretariat located in New Delhi. The Election Commissioners are assisted by
            Deputy Election Commissioners, who are generally IAS officers. They are further assisted by Directors
            General, Principal Secretaries, and Secretaries and Under Secretaries. <br><br>
            At the state level, Election Commission is assisted by the Chief Electoral Officer of the State, who is an
            IAS officer of Principal Secretary rank. At the district and constituency levels, the District Magistrates
            (in their capacity as District Election Officers), Electoral Registration Officers and Returning Officers
            perform election work.
            <p class="heading2">Removal from office</p>
            The Chief Election Commissioner of India can be removed from their office in a manner similar to the removal
            of a judge of the Supreme Court of India which requires a resolution passed by the Parliament of India a
            two-thirds majority in both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha on the grounds of proved misbehaviour or
            incapacity. <br><br>
            Other Election Commissioners can be removed by the President of India on the recommendation of the Chief
            Election Commissioner. A Chief Election Commissioner has never been impeached in India. <br><br>
            In 2009, just before the 2009 Lok Sabha Elections, Chief Election Commissioner N. Gopalaswami sent a
            recommendation to President Prathibha Patil to remove Election Commissioner Navin Chawla, who was soon to
            take office as the chief election commissioner and to subsequently supervise the Lok Sabha general election,
            a potential conflict of interest considering his partisan political party behavior. The President opined
            that such a recommendation is not binding on the president, and hence rejected it. Subsequently, after
            Gopalswami's retirement the next month, Chawla became the chief election commissioner and supervised the
            2009 Lok Sabha general elections.

        <div class="content">
            One of the most important features of the democratic policy in India is elections at regular intervals.
            Holding periodic, free and fair elections are essentials of a democratic system and a part of the basic
            structure of the Constitution. The Election Commission is regarded as the guardian of elections in the
            country. In every election, it issues a Model Code of Conduct for political parties and candidates to
            conduct elections in a free and fair manner. The commission issued the Code of Conduct for the first time in
            1971 for the 5th Lok Sabha elections and has revised it from time to time. It lays down guidelines for the
            conduct of political parties and candidates during an election period. However, there have been instances of
            violation of the code by various political parties with complaints being received for misuse of official
            machinery by the candidates. The code does not have any specific statutory basis but only a persuasive
            effect. It contains the rules of electoral morality. However, this lack of statutory backing does not
            prevent the commission from enforcing it.
            <br>
            A law for the registration process for political parties was enacted in 1989 and a number of parties got
            registered with the commission. The registration helps avoid confusion and ensures that the political
            parties are brought under the purview of the commission.
            <br>
            The election commission has the right to allow symbols to the political parties. It gives recognition to the
            national parties, state parties and regional parties. It sets limits on poll expenses. The commission
            prepare electoral rolls and update the voter's list from time to time. Notifications of dates and schedules
            of election for filing nominations are issued by the commission. It is noteworthy that Election commission
            cannot allot same symbol to two regional political parties even if they are not in the same state.
            <br>
            The commission is empowered with prohibiting dissemination or publication of voting trends that seek to
            influence voters by opinion polls or exit polls.
            <br>
            To curb the growing influence of money during elections, the Election Commission has made many suggestions
            and changes in this regard. The commission has appointed IRS officers of the Income Tax Department as
            Election Observers (Expenditure) of all elections and has fixed the legal limits on the amount of money
            which a candidate can spend during election campaigns. These limits have been revised over time. The
            Election Commission, by appointing expenditure observers from the Indian Revenue Service, keeps an eye on
            the individual account of election expenditure. The commission takes details of the candidate's assets on
            affidavit at the time of submitting nomination paper, who are also required to give details of their
            expenditure within 30 days of the declaration of results. The campaign period has also been reduced by the
            commission from 21 to 14 days for Lok Sabha and Assembly elections to cut down election expenditure.
            <br>
            In an attempt to decriminalise politics, the Election Commission has approached the Supreme Court to put a
            lifetime ban on convicted politicians from contesting elections.
            <div class="heading2">Voter Id</div>
            In an effort to prevent electoral fraud, in 1993, EPICs or Electors Photo Identity Cards were issued, which
            became mandatory by the 2004 elections. However ration cards have been allowed for election purposes in
            certain situations.
            <div class="heading2">RONET</div>
            Software mobile application, developed for Election Commission of India, by 01 Synergy, which makes the
            voting process less cumbersome and ensure that the general public is aware of the candidates in an election.
            The RONet suite of web and mobile applications is for all stakeholders involved in the election process.
            This would help them monitor the assigned tasks at all levels for the smooth conduct of elections.
            <div class="heading2">ECI360</div>
            ECI 360 mobile application was developed for the general public — which comprises signed and sworn
            affidavits of the contesting candidates, a list of rejected candidates, the final list of candidates, pickup
            requests for voters with disability, queue status (people waiting in line to cast votes), real-time poll
            booth-wise polling percentage, grievance redressal, and the results. The candidate app of ECI360 allows them
            to request permissions for rallies and is also mapped with redressal systems, which ensures that all the
            issues are sorted at the earliest.

            Voting Procedure
            <hr>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            Voting in India is done using Electronic voting machines or EVMs, there is also a provision for the *
            Postal voting in India, as well as the special arrangements for the disabled voters
            <div class="heading2">Electronic voting machines (EVM)</div>
            India has been the first country to adopt Electronic Voting at such a large scale. Electronic voting
            machines (EVM) were introduced by Election Commission in order to reduce malpractices and improve
            efficiency. They were tried for the first time on an experimental basis for the 1982 Kerala State
            Legislative Assembly Elections. After a successful testing and the legal inquiries, the commission took the
            decision to begin the use of these voting machines. <br>
            The introduction of Voter-verified paper audit trail (VVPAT) in eight Lok Sabha constituencies in 2014
            Indian General Elections was a big achievement for the Election Commission. This Voter-verified paper audit
            trail (VVPAT) system was first used with EVMs in a by-poll in September 2013 in Noksen (Assembly
            Constituency) in Nagaland.[38] and eventually in all elections from September 2013 onwards in various
            Legislative elections in the country. <br>
            Photo electoral rolls with photographs of the candidates on the EVMs were first introduced in the 2015 Bihar
            Legislative Assembly election. <br>
            In 2014, none of the above or NOTA was also added as an option on the voting machines which is now a
            mandatory option to be provided in any election. The specific symbol for NOTA, a ballot paper with a black
            cross across it, was introduced on 18 September 2015. The symbol has been designed by National Institute of
            Design, Ahmedabad. <br>
            Election Commission organised an open hackathon on 3 June 2017, to attempt hacking of Electronic Voting
            Machine used by the commission in various Indian elections. The NCP and CPI(M) were the only two parties
            that registered for the event but none of them participated. Functioning of EVMs and VVPAT machines were
            demonstrated to the teams.
            <div class="heading2">Postal voting</div>
            Postal voting in India is done only through the "Electronically Transmitted Postal Ballot Papers (ETPB)"
            system of Election Commission of India, ballot papers are distributed to the registered eligible voters who
            return the votes by post. Postal votes are counted first before the counting of votes from the EVM. Only
            certain categories of people are eligible to register as postal voters. Employees working in the union armed
            forces and state police as well as their spouses, and those working for the Government of India who are
            officially posted abroad can register for the postal vote, these are also called the "Service voters".
            People in preventive detention can use postal vote. Prisoners can not vote at all.
            <br> 
            <div class="heading2">Electors with disabilities</div>
            The Election Commission of India came under severe criticism when an RTI application filed by activist Dr
            Satendra Singh revealed the commission's ill-preparedness to safeguard electors with disabilities in the
            2014 Lok Sabha elections. There were many violations of the Supreme Court order from 2014 to enfranchise
            persons with disabilities
