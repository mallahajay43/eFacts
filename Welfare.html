            Scheduled castes are those castes/races in the country that suffer from extreme social, educational and
            economic backwardness arising out of age-old practice of untouchability and certain others on account of
            lack of infrastructure facilities and geographical isolation, and who need special consideration for
            safeguarding their interests and for their accelerated socio-economic development. These communities were
            notified as Scheduled Castes as per provisions contained in Clause 1 of Article 341 of the Constitution.
